### About Me ...
I’m a backend engineer who blends creativity with technology to build meaningful, secure,  
and scalable systems. My main stack revolves around **Laravel** and **.NET**, supported  
by a strong foundation in networking, cybersecurity, and modern web practices.

I see coding as a craft — a way to design something timeless that helps others build,  
create, and innovate.
